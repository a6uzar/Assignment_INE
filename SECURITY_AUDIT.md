### esbuild <=0.24.2
- **Severity**: Moderate

- **Impact**: Development environment only (not production)
- **Fix**: No fix available currently
- **Mitigation**: This only affects development builds, production builds are not affected

### Dependencies affected:
- `esbuild` (dev dependency)
- `vite` (dev dependency)

## Monitoring
- Run `npm audit` regularly to check for new vulnerabilities
- Update dependencies when fixes become available
